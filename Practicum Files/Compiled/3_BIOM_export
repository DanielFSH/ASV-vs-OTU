The following code was used to export the resulting BIOM file into a tsv file:
In the ASV directory
biom convert -i feature-table.biom -o pseudo-asv.tsv –to-tsv
In the OTU directory
biom convert -i feature-table.biom -o pseudo-otu.tsv –to-tsv

I then used the exported files alongside the relative_frequency.R R file to generate relative freqeuncy 
tables from the ASV and OTU data.
