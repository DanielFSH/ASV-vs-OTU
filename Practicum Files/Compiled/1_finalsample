Use the Metadata.csv and the DIABIMMUNE data files to run the code in the R file "final_sample.R" 
to generate the kareliametadata.csv file,
which has the selected 199 samples and the related metadata. 



The Metadata_vis.R R file was used to inspect the data initially, and to make
various decisions about how to select the final sample.
