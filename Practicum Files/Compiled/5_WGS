I first moved only the files of the selected 199 samples to another directory using the following code

#The sample code I noted down was:
parallel  -a Repasv20_metagenomic.txt cp {}_profile.txt Repasv20

#code used to move selected files from a text file:
parallel  -a MetagenomicSample.txt cp {}_pe_1.fasq.gz,{}_pe_2.fasq.gz,{}_se_1.fasq.gz,{}_se_2.fasq.gz Complete 

The Micropitavenndiagram_rel.R file has a section for the metagenomic data,
it takes into account which of the 199 16s rRNA samples had a corresponding
WGS sample that was able to be processed using Metaphlan 3.

It then produces text files, each with the wgs sample ids of the sample that were selected,
for each of the subsampling methods. 
It also produces a similar file, containing the samples and the associated allergy label for the samples selected.


the wgssamples.sh file makes use of the text files, to make copies of the correct sample, 
and move them to distinct directories, one for each subsampling method, keeping ASVs or OTUs separate.
The samples in each directory are merged using Metaphlan 3. 

The merged file, in conjuction with the allergy information, was used for LEfSe analysis.
