singularity build qiime2-2021.11.sif docker://quay.io/qiime2/core:2021.11

Using the qiime image, and the manifest file, and the 16s rRNA files
I then used the demultiplex.sh bash script to make a qiime object containing the demultiplexed data.
called paired-end-karelia.qza

I used visualize_demultiplex.sh to generate a qiime object that can be visualy examined, 
to decide appropriate quality score cutoffs. 

For the ASVs I used the dada2.sh script to process the reads.
the input is the paired-end-karelia.qza file
the output files asv-karelia-rep-seqs.qza and asv-karelia-rep-seqs are used for taxonomy and phylogeny

For the OTUs I used the deblur.sh script to process the reads.
The same input as for the ASVs
the output files are karelia-rep-seqs-deblur.qza and karelia-table-deblur.qza.


the taxonomy-and-differetial.sh script generate taxonomy data from the ASV/OTUs using the silva classifier
It collapses based on genus level and then generates differential abundance data from the ASV/OTU table.
It then generates relative frequencies and then exports the table.

The code was adaptated accordingly to reference and generate the approriate files in the ASV or OTU directory.
